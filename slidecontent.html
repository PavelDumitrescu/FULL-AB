    <p class="slidecontent">DCS World is a study sim in which players learn how to operate aircraft using realistic procedures. Aircraft are meticulously modeled from real-world data, including authentic flight models and subsystems and detailed cockpits with interactive buttons and switches. Digital manuals document the history, systems and operation of each aircraft in extensive detail. The game has extensive support for joysticks and HOTAS input devices ranging from gamepads to 1:1</p>
    <p class="slidecontent">DCS World supports a wide variety of combat operations including combat air patrol, dogfighting, airstrikes, close air support, SEAD and airlifts. Dozens of military airplanes and helicopters are available, spanning eras from World War II through the Cold War into the early 21st century. Popular modules as of March 2022 include the AH-64D, F-16C, F/A-18C, F-14 and A-10C.</p>
    <p class="slidecontent">DCS World acts as a unified modular platform, in contrast to previous installments in the series which were standalone products. This allows users of different modules to switch between aircraft and play together within a single game client. The platform also allows third-party developers to publish modules through Eagle Dynamics' storefront.</p>
